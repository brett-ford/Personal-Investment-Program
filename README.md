# Personal Investment Program 

A personal investment program (pip) is a plan that periodically invests funds. Customers set up pip plans in order to automate their investing. 

This query returns a table with three new columns for each customer pip: the value of the funds that have already been invested under the plan, the value of funds remaining to be invested under the plan, and the total value of the plan. It also returns all original columns from the queried table. 

I wrote this query while consulting for a major financial services firm.
